# Subscription_app_behaviour_analysis

In this Case Study we will be working for a fintech company that wants to provide its customers with a paid mobile app subscription that will allow them to track all of their finances in one place. To attract customers, the company releases a free version of their app with some of the main features unlocked.

The company has tasked you to identify which users will mostly likely NOT enroll in paid products, so that additional offers can be given to them. Because of the costs of these offers, the company does not want to offer them to everybody, especially customers who were going to enroll anyways.

This is solely done by me! and there's other one done by a team of three.
